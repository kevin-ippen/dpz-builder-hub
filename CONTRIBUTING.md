## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and professional in all interactions. We're building a collaborative community around data governance.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 - 3.12** (as defined in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Node.js 18+** (includes npm, the frontend package manager)
- **Hatch** (Python build tool):
  ```bash
  pip install hatch
  ```

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ontos.git
   cd ontos
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/databrickslabs/ontos.git
   ```

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend dependencies
cd src/frontend
npm install

# Backend dependencies are managed by Hatch and installed automatically
```

#### Working Behind a Private npm Mirror (optional)

Some corporate environments block the public npm registry and require all
package traffic to flow through an internal mirror (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory,
Verdaccio, or an HTTPS pass-through proxy). npm handles this cleanly: point the
registry at your mirror and npm rewrites the host of each `resolved` URL at
install time. Because npm's `replace-registry-host` defaults to `"npmjs"`, the
committed `package-lock.json` keeps its canonical `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
URLs, and `npm ci` does **not** persist the rewrite back to the lockfile — so
there is no diff to worry about and no git filter needed.

Set the registry per-clone without committing anything:

```bash
# In the frontend project (or globally via ~/.npmrc)
npm config set registry https://<your-mirror-host>/
```

`npm install`, `npm ci`, and `npm install <pkg>` all work normally, and any
commits you make contain only real dependency changes against the public
registry URLs. Integrity hashes (`integrity sha512-...`) are independent of the
URL, so package verification is unaffected.

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

See **[CONFIGURING.md](CONFIGURING.md)** for complete documentation on:
- All environment variables
- Database setup (local PostgreSQL and Lakebase)
- Connection pool tuning
- Default roles configuration

### 3. Start Development Servers

**Frontend** (Terminal 1):
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run dev:frontend
```

**Backend** (Terminal 2):
```bash
cd src
npm run dev:backend
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs (Swagger): http://localhost:8000/docs

### Running Multiple Worktrees Side-by-Side

If you develop in more than one git worktree at once (e.g. one per feature
branch), **each worktree must run its own frontend and backend on distinct
ports** — otherwise a second worktree's servers bind to the same 3000/8000 and
either fail to start or, worse, serve one branch's frontend against the other
branch's backend. The default `3000`/`8000` are fine for a single worktree;
give every additional worktree its own pair.

The frontend port and proxy target are env-var driven; the backend port is
passed directly to `uvicorn`:

| Variable | Default | Controls |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `VITE_PORT` | `3000` | Vite dev-server port |
| `VITE_PROXY_TARGET` | `http://localhost:8000` | backend the Vite dev server proxies `/api`, `/docs`, `/redoc` to |

Point the frontend at its own backend with `VITE_PROXY_TARGET` so the proxy
targets the matching port. Example — a second worktree on backend `8100` /
frontend `3100`:

**Backend** (from `src/`): invoke `uvicorn` directly with the port you want.
The `yarn dev:backend` / `hatch -e dev run dev-backend` shortcut is hard-coded to
`8000`, so a secondary worktree runs the underlying command instead:
```bash
hatch -e dev run uvicorn --app-dir backend src.app:app --reload --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8100
```

**Frontend** (from `src/frontend/`):
```bash
VITE_PORT=3100 VITE_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8100 yarn dev:frontend
```

Both worktrees can share the same local `app_ontos` PostgreSQL database; only
the HTTP ports need to differ.

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages. This enables automatic changelog generation and semantic versioning.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Changes to build system or dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

### Scope (optional)

The scope provides additional context. Common scopes include:

- `frontend` - React/TypeScript frontend changes
- `backend` - Python/FastAPI backend changes
- `api` - API endpoint changes
- `db` - Database/model changes
- `auth` - Authentication/authorization changes
- `contracts` - Data contracts feature
- `products` - Data products feature
- `compliance` - Compliance policies feature
- `semantic` - Semantic models feature
- `mcp` - MCP integration

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
feat(contracts): add schema validation for ODCS v3.1.0

# Bug fix
fix(backend): correct date parsing in contract import

# Documentation
docs: update API documentation for MCP endpoints

# Refactoring
refactor(frontend): extract form components into shared module

# Breaking change (use ! or BREAKING CHANGE footer)
feat(api)!: change data product response format

# With body and footer
feat(products): add data lineage visualization

Implements interactive DAG view for data product dependencies.
Uses react-flow for rendering and supports zoom/pan navigation.

Closes #123
```

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, ensure:

1. **Tests pass**:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd src && hatch -e dev run test
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd src/frontend && npm run test:run
   ```

2. **Linting passes**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd src && hatch -e dev run lint:all
   
   # Frontend
   cd src/frontend && npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Commit message follows convention**

---

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Version Files

The project tracks version in multiple files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/pyproject.toml` | Python/Hatch build config (source of truth) |
| `src/backend/src/__init__.py` | Python runtime `__version__` |
| `src/frontend/package.json` | Node/npm frontend |
| `src/package.json` | Root build helper |

### Bump Version Script

Use the provided script to keep all version files in sync:

```bash
# View current versions
python src/scripts/bump_version.py

# Update all files to a new version
python src/scripts/bump_version.py 0.5.0

# Dry run (preview changes without applying)
python src/scripts/bump_version.py --dry-run 0.5.0
```

The script will:
1. Update all version files
2. Print next steps for committing and tagging

---

## Release Process

### 1. Prepare Release

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create release branch (optional for larger releases)
git checkout -b release/0.5.0
```

### 2. Update Version

```bash
python src/scripts/bump_version.py 0.5.0
```

### 3. Update Changelog (if maintaining one)

Add release notes to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing changes since last release.

### 4. Commit and Tag

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.5.0"
git tag v0.5.0
```

### 5. Push

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin v0.5.0
# Or if on release branch:
# git push origin release/0.5.0
# Then create PR and merge
```

### 6. Create GitHub Release

1. Go to GitHub Releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag `v0.5.0`
4. Add release notes (can be auto-generated from commits)
5. Publish

### 7. Deploy

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --var="catalog=app_data" --var="schema=app_ontos"
databricks apps deploy <app-name>
```

---

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   cd src && hatch -e dev run test
   cd src/frontend && npm run test:run
   ```

3. **Check types and lint**:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend && npm run type-check
   ```

### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use conventional commit format
   - `feat(products): add export to YAML feature`
   
2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were needed
   - How to test the changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes

3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
   - Large features should be broken into smaller PRs

4. **Reviews**: 
   - At least one approval required
   - Address all review comments

### After Merge

- Delete your feature branch
- Pull latest main to your local

---

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints extensively
- Use `async def` for async operations
- Max line length: 100 characters

```python
async def get_data_product(
    product_id: str,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
) -> DataProductResponse:
    """Retrieve a data product by ID."""
    ...
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` where avoidable)
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices

```typescript
interface DataProductCardProps {
  product: DataProduct;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
}

export const DataProductCard: React.FC<DataProductCardProps> = ({
  product,
  onSelect,
}) => {
  // ...
};
```

### File Naming

- **Python**: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `data_products_manager.py`)
- **TypeScript**: `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `data-product-card.tsx`)
- **Tests**: `test_*.py` or `*.test.tsx`

---

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd src

# Run all tests
hatch -e dev run test

# Run with coverage
hatch -e dev run test-cov

# Run specific test file
hatch -e dev run pytest backend/src/tests/unit/test_data_products.py
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd src/frontend

# Run tests
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests next to the code or in `tests/unit/`
- Name tests descriptively: `test_create_data_product_validates_schema`
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Aim for >80% coverage on new code

### Local Directory Provider (PrincipalPicker testing)

Many surfaces in the app use the `PrincipalPicker` to resolve users and
groups against the configured Directory provider (Roles, Entitlements,
Reviews, Comments audience, Workflow Designer custom principals, Data
Contract wizard owner/stakeholders, etc.). To exercise the configured
code path locally without standing up an Entra ID tenant or a Lakebase
table, use the bundled `file` provider against the sample CSV at
`src/backend/src/data/principals.csv`.

The CSV ships with three users (Alice / Bob / Carol) and three groups
(Producers / Consumers / Admins) and matches the format the
`FileProvider` expects:

```csv
type,id,display_name,sub_label
user,alice@example.com,Alice Liddell,alice@example.com
user,bob@example.com,Bob Builder,bob@example.com
user,carol@example.com,Carol Carlsson,carol@example.com
group,Producers,Data Producers,producers-guid
group,Consumers,Data Consumers,consumers-guid
group,Admins,Platform Admins,admins-guid
```

**Configure via the UI (recommended):**

1. Start the dev servers (see [Development Setup](#development-setup)).
2. Sign in as a user with `settings:READ_WRITE` permission.
3. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Directory**.
4. Pick **CSV file (test / demo)** as the Provider.
5. Set **CSV file path** to the absolute path of the bundled file, e.g.
   `/Users/you/code/ontos/src/backend/src/data/principals.csv`.
6. Click **Save**, then **Test connection** — you should see a success
   toast.

**Configure via the backend directly** (e.g. in a test fixture or
seed script):

```python
from src.repositories.app_settings_repository import app_settings_repo

app_settings_repo.set_by_key(db, "DIRECTORY_PROVIDER_TYPE", "file")
app_settings_repo.set_by_key(
    db,
    "DIRECTORY_FILE_PATH",
    "/absolute/path/to/src/backend/src/data/principals.csv",
)
```

**Verify it works:**

- `GET /api/directory/status` → `{ "configured": true, "provider_type": "file", "file_path": "/…/principals.csv" }`
- `GET /api/directory/search?q=ali&types=users` → returns Alice
- In any picker (e.g. Assign Owner on a Data Product), type `al` —
  the dropdown should show a two-line row with `Alice Liddell` and
  `alice@example.com` underneath.

The file is re-read whenever its `mtime` advances, so editing the CSV
takes effect on the next picker query without a server restart. The
sample file is checked in as a fixture — feel free to extend it
locally, but please don't commit org-specific edits.

### Testing with Different User Personas (Runtime Impersonation)

The app supports per-request user impersonation via HTTP headers, so you can
test how features behave for different personas (Admin, Data Producer,
Consumer, etc.) against the **same running backend** — no restarts, works with
or without the Vite dev server in front.

**Setup:**

1. Pick a shared-secret token, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`.
2. Set it on the backend: `TEST_USER_TOKEN=<your-token>` in
   `src/backend/.env`.
3. (Optional, for the UI picker) set the same value as
   `VITE_TEST_USER_TOKEN=<your-token>` in `src/frontend/.env`.

**Usage from the UI:**

When `TEST_USER_TOKEN` is configured, the user-info dropdown gains a
"Test persona" section listing personas defined in
`src/backend/src/data/test_personas.yaml`. Pick one and the page reloads
with every API request impersonating that user. A yellow ring around the
avatar indicates an active persona.

**Usage from curl / Playwright / any HTTP client:**

```bash
curl -H "X-Test-Token: <your-token>" \
     -H "X-Test-User-Email: producer@test.local" \
     -H "X-Test-User-Groups: [\"data-producers\"]" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/user/details
```

- `X-Test-User-Email` is required when `X-Test-Token` matches.
- `X-Test-User-Groups` is optional (JSON array or comma-separated). When
  omitted, the backend falls back to a real SCIM lookup so the persona
  reflects actual workspace state.
- Optional refinement headers: `X-Test-User-Username`,
  `X-Test-User-Name`, `X-Test-User-Ip`.

**Security notes:**

- The override is gated on `TEST_USER_TOKEN` being set server-side. Leave it
  UNSET in production.
- The token itself is never returned by the server. The persona discovery
  endpoint (`GET /api/test/personas`) returns 404 when the feature is
  disabled.
- This mechanism is complementary to the env-based `MOCK_USER_*` variables
  (which require restarts) and to the in-process FastAPI
  `app.dependency_overrides[get_user_details_from_sdk]` pattern used by
  most integration tests.

See `src/backend/src/tests/integration/test_user_header_override.py` for
worked examples.

## Supply Chain Security

This project follows GitHub Actions supply chain security best practices as required for `databrickslabs` repos.

### Action Pinning

All GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/` must be pinned to full SHA commits with a version comment:

```yaml
# Correct
uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4

# Incorrect
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) will automatically open PRs when new action versions are available.

### Python Dependency Pinning

Python dependencies use a two-file pattern:

- `requirements.in` - Source constraint files with version ranges (what you edit)
- `requirements.txt` - Locked files with exact versions and hashes (what CI installs)

To regenerate locked files after updating `.in` files:

```bash
./scripts/lock-requirements.sh
```

This requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and PyPI access. The script runs `uv pip compile --generate-hashes` for all three requirement sets (`src/`, `src/backend/`, `src/e2e/`).

### Alembic Migration Heads

The database migration history under `src/backend/alembic/versions/` must always
have **exactly one head**. Two PRs that branch off the same Alembic tip and each
add a sibling revision will leave `main` with multiple heads, and app startup
will crash in `init_db` with `script directory has multiple heads`.

CI enforces this via the **Alembic Single-Head Check** job in
`.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`. On every PR it runs
`scripts/check-alembic-heads.py`, which:

1. Loads the PR's `versions/` tree and fails if `alembic heads` returns more
   than one head.
2. Fails if any newly added revision's `down_revision` is not reachable from
   the PR base branch's tip — i.e. you forgot to rebase before authoring the
   migration.

**Remediation when the check fails:**

- Rebase your branch onto the current base, drop your revision file, and
  re-run `alembic revision -m '<message>'` so the new revision descends from
  the live head.
- Or, if a merge revision is the right call (your branch and another both
  shipped migrations independently), run
  `alembic merge -m 'merge heads' <head_a> <head_b>` and commit the resulting
  file.

**Escape hatch:** Apply the `alembic-branch` label to the PR to bypass the
check. Use this only when the multi-head state is intentional and a merge
revision is planned in the same PR.

### Workflow Permissions

All workflows must declare a minimal `permissions` block at the workflow level:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

Only add additional permissions (e.g., `issues: write`) if the workflow genuinely requires them.
