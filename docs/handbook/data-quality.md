# Data Quality

Data quality in Ontos is split into **two parallel systems** that interact at
specific seams. Customers consistently get confused here — they assume the
quality checks on the contract are also the execution results, and they ask
where DQX-style profiling output lives. The short version: the contract
holds *definitions*; a separate per-entity store holds *measurements*; the
DQX workflow is the most-integrated execution path; everything else lands
via the `external` source.

## What you see in Ontos

### The two systems at a glance {#two-systems}

| System | What it stores | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| Contract quality checks | Check **definitions** — the rule, dimension, severity, threshold | Contract detail page → **Quality Rules** section: per-object and per-column check rows authored by the Steward. The contract page also has a **Profile with DQX** button (the action that generates these rules) |
| Per-entity quality measurements | Check **measurements** — score, pass/fail, when, by which engine | Data Product detail page → **Quality panel**: rolled-up scores by dimension and source |

A contract that has 12 checks defined and zero measurements is normal —
the contract is the design intent, the measurements are what actually
happened last Tuesday at 03:00.

### DQX integration — what you do, step by step {#dqx-flow}

DQX is the most-tightly-wired integration. It is a complete loop, not a
one-shot.

**Step 1 — Steward kicks off profiling.** On the contract detail page,
click the **Profile with DQX** action. This launches a background
profiling workflow.

**Step 2 — Workflow profiles a sample.** For each schema in the
contract, the workflow profiles a sample of the underlying data
(approximately 10% of rows, capped at 5,000) and proposes quality
rules from what it observes.

**Step 3 — Suggestions appear inline.** The proposed rules land as
**pending suggestions** visible on the contract's Schema tab next to
the corresponding columns. They are *not yet* real checks — they're a
draft waiting for your review.

**Step 4 — Review and accept.** From the contract's Schema tab, you see
each pending suggestion inline with the column it targets. **Accept** to
promote it to a real check; **Reject** to dismiss; or **Edit** to
modify thresholds before accepting.

**Step 5 — Periodic re-measurement.** Later runs of profiling (or any
quality engine configured against the contract) re-measure the columns
and post new measurements against the right contract source.

**Step 6 — Rollup feeds the Quality panel.** The Data Product detail
page Quality panel averages the latest measurement per dimension and
shows the overall quality score, the per-dimension breakdown, and the
per-source breakdown.

**Step 7 — Subscribers get compliance alerts.** A subscription to a
data product implicitly subscribes the consumer to compliance alerts
for the bound contracts. When a measurement at `error` severity fails,
subscribers are notified via the configured notification channels.

Profiling-run state surfaces inside Ontos — if a profiling run fails,
the contract page shows the failure status and the error so you don't
have to drill into the Databricks Workflows UI to find out what went
wrong.

### Where quality surfaces in the UI {#where-it-surfaces}

- **Data Product detail page → Quality panel.** Reads the rolled-up
  quality summary for the contracts bound to the product. Shows
  per-dimension scores and per-source breakdown. This is the "is my
  product healthy?" view.
- **Data Contract detail page → Schema tab.** Shows per-check
  *definitions* attached to each schema object / property, plus
  *suggested* checks pending review from the most recent profiling run.
  This is the "what does the contract require?" view.
- **Subscription compliance alerts.** A consumer who subscribes to a
  data product receives notifications when the bound contract's quality
  checks fail at `error` severity. The channels are configured per
  notification type.

### External quality sources {#external-sources}

Customers running their own DQ pipelines outside Ontos can still get
their results to show up in the Quality panel. The supported sources
the platform recognizes:

- **Manual** — entered by hand (a Steward filling in a one-time number).
- **dbt** — dbt test results. Supported as a source value; the dedicated
  import path is not yet shipping in the current Ontos version, so use
  the external path below in the meantime.
- **DQX** — the integrated path described above.
- **Great Expectations** — same status as dbt.
- **Soda** — same status.
- **External** — a deliberate catch-all. Custom DQ pipelines can post
  measurements through the public quality API and the rollup treats
  them like any other source.

If you have an organization-standard DQ tool that isn't on this list,
the recipe is: post your results through the external source, populate
the dimension and score, and the rollup will pick them up.

## Under the hood

### ODCS check definitions on the contract {#contract-check-definitions}

A `DataQualityCheckDb` row carries:

- **Level** — `object` (whole table) or `property` (one column). Property
  checks set `property_id`; object checks leave it null.
- **Dimension** — one of the ODCS-native dimensions: `accuracy`,
  `completeness`, `conformity`, `consistency`, `coverage`, `timeliness`,
  `uniqueness`.
- **Business impact** — `operational` or `regulatory`. Drives how a
  violation propagates: operational fires consumer alerts; regulatory
  additionally flags compliance.
- **Severity** — `info`, `warning`, or `error`. Surfaces in UI badges and
  in subscriber notifications.
- **Type** — `library` (a named reusable rule), `text` (free description
  the steward fills in), `sql` (a `query` field with a SQL predicate), or
  `custom` (with an `engine` and `implementation` field for plugging in
  external tooling).
- **A family of declarative comparator fields** — `must_be`,
  `must_not_be`, `must_be_gt`, `must_be_lt`, `must_be_between_min`,
  `must_be_between_max`, etc. These are how the steward expresses "this
  metric must be greater than 0.99" without writing SQL.

Definitions ride along with the contract through its lifecycle. They are
not executed by the contract itself. Something else has to actually
measure the column and report back — see the next section.

### Per-entity measurements and rollup {#measurements-and-rollup}

A `QualityItemDb` row is generic: scoped by `entity_type` (one of
`data_product`, `data_contract`, `asset`, `data_domain`) and `entity_id`.
Each row records one measurement at one moment by one source.

The row carries:

- `score_percent` (0–100)
- `checks_passed`, `checks_total`
- `measured_at` (timestamp)
- `dimension` — same enum as the contract-check dimension
- `source` — one of `manual`, `dbt`, `dqx`, `great_expectations`, `soda`,
  `external`. (See [external sources](#external-sources) above.)

`QualityManager.aggregate_for_product` is the rollup that the Data Product
detail page reads. The logic is:

1. Find the contracts bound to the product (via output ports → contract
   ID).
2. Pull all `QualityItemDb` rows for those contract IDs.
3. Keep the **latest** measurement per `(entity_type, entity_id,
   dimension)` tuple. Stale measurements drop out — only the freshest
   reading per dimension survives.
4. Average per-dimension and per-source.
5. Return a `QualitySummary` with `overall_score_percent`,
   `by_dimension`, and `by_source`.

Crucially, a data product does **not** own quality directly. The product's
Quality panel is a view over the contracts it binds. If you want quality
to show up on a product, attach a contract to one of its output ports and
let measurements flow into that contract.

### DQX workflow internals {#dqx-internals}

The Profile with DQX action launches the `dqx_profile_datasets` workflow.
For each schema in the contract, the workflow uses
`databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler.DQProfiler` to profile a sample
(10% sample, capped at 5000 rows). It hands the profile to `DQGenerator`
and calls `generator.generate_dq_rules(profiles, level="error")` to
propose rules.

Each generated rule lands as a row in the `suggested_quality_checks`
table with `status = 'pending'`. Accepting a suggestion promotes it
into a real `DataQualityCheckDb` attached to the relevant
`SchemaObjectDb` or `SchemaPropertyDb`. Later periodic profiling runs
write `QualityItemDb` rows with `source = 'dqx'`.

Profiling-run state is tracked in `data_profiling_runs`. Each run has a
`status` (`running` / `completed` / `failed`) and a `summary_stats` blob.
A failed run surfaces `status = 'failed'` plus an `error_message`.

### DQX → ODCS dimension mapping {#dqx-odcs-mapping}

DQX has its own rule names. When suggestions are written, those names map
to ODCS dimensions:

| DQX rule name pattern | ODCS dimension |
|---|---|
| `is_not_null` | `completeness` |
| `is_in`, `min_max`, `pattern` | `conformity` |
| `is_unique` | `uniqueness` |
| anything else | `accuracy` (fallback) |

This means a profiling run will populate several dimensions at once for a
typical column. The fallback to `accuracy` is intentional — it ensures
every DQX rule lands somewhere on the ODCS scale even if there's no
obvious mapping.

### External source enum and write path {#external-source-internals}

The `source` enum supports `manual`, `dbt`, `dqx`, `great_expectations`,
`soda`, `external`. For the engines whose dedicated importer isn't
shipping yet (`dbt`, `great_expectations`, `soda`), the practical path
today is to write `QualityItemDb` rows via the manager with
`source='external'`, populate the dimension and score, and let the
rollup pick them up. This is the same path the integrated engines use;
the only difference is which workflow writes the rows.

## Common questions {#common-questions}

**"How do DQX checks made outside Ontos surface inside Ontos?"**

Two paths. (1) If your external DQX pipeline writes back to the
`QualityItemDb` table via the manager with `source='dqx'`, they show up in
the product's Quality panel automatically. (2) If your pipeline writes to
its own custom delta tables, those results are invisible to Ontos until
something translates them into `QualityItemDb` rows. There is no current
shipping job that reads from arbitrary external DQX delta tables.

**"If I accept 14 suggested rules from a profiling run, do they go back
into the contract YAML?"**

Yes — at least within Ontos. Accepting a suggestion promotes it from
`suggested_quality_checks` to a real `DataQualityCheckDb` row attached to
the contract's schema object or property. The contract's ODCS export
includes those checks. If you maintain a YAML copy of the contract in
your workspace (indirect-delivery via volume), the next contract version
generated by Ontos will reflect the new checks. The seam between Ontos's
DB-of-record and an externally-edited YAML is a place where teams need to
pick one as authoritative — see
[data-contract-lifecycle.md](data-contract-lifecycle.md#editor-of-record).

**"Does Ontos own DQ execution or just observe results?"**

For DQX it owns execution (the workflow runs from the contract page and
writes back). For everything else, Ontos prefers to *observe* — it
expects the engine of record (your dbt project, your Great Expectations
suite, your Soda checks) to write its results to `QualityItemDb` and lets
the rollup do its work. Customers who want Ontos to be the orchestrator
of all DQ runs are at a sharp end of the spec — the current Ontos version
is biased toward observation.

**"Where do I see a failed profiling job?"**

Inside Ontos. The `data_profiling_runs` row has a `status` field and an
`error_message`. The contract page surfaces the latest run status. The
single-pane-of-glass goal is intentional — customers shouldn't need to
chase the Databricks Workflows UI to find out why a profiling job
failed.

**"Can I import dbt test results?"**

The `source='dbt'` enum exists, so the schema is ready. But the
dedicated import workflow is not currently shipping. The pragmatic path
today is to use the `external` source and write your dbt test outcomes
through the manager. Treat this as an evolving area — first-class dbt
integration is the kind of thing that becomes a discrete shipped feature
later.
